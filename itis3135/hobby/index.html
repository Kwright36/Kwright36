			<h2>Writing for <s>Dummies</s> Me</h2>
            <p>
                Writing is the base of humanity. We use it to find ways to define our thoughts, feelings, and expressions of our inner beings.
                With it, we can create something out of nothing. Humanity is nothing if not a culmination of our past reimagining itself
                to fit into our future, and writing acheives that. It gives us an outlet so that all of the raging noise within
                our heads finally escapes. Writing helps release the pressure of overwhelming thoughts and visions that feel like they'll
                seep out our orifices if not granted escaped from our mortal coils. <p>

                <p>That is to say, I enjoy writing.</p>

                <p>Writing to me is cathartic and helps to soothe the creator's soul. There's so much range when it comes to writing as well,
                which gives it so much more life. If I tire of horror, I can create a comedy. If laughs grow too loud for my ears,
                I can craft a tragedy that will make even the hardest lacrimal glands ache from pressure. There is a freedom in writing that I adore,
                and I hope the awe will never leave me.
                </p>

			<h2>About Me</h2>

            <p>
                I am just a girl trying to bring her visions to life. I have been writing for over eleven years now with no intent to stop. While there have definitely be
                times where I am more active than not, I have have always maintained a creative mind. I currently have no accreditted works to my name, but I have participated
                in a few writing contests in recent years when I have had the time to do so.

            </figure>

            <p>
                While my roots were more based in the fantastical side of things, my tastes and talents have definitely grown darker over the years. This is definitely
                not in part due to spending much of my youth watching PewDiePie play horror game after horror game and my own developing interest in the horror genre as
                a whole.

			<h2>When To Write</h2>

            <p>
                Ah, the age old question of when do I write. The answer is as simple as ascertaining the state of Schrodingner's Cat.

            <p> 
                Finding time to write is a constant battle, especially when one finally has the <i>time</i> to write, somehow motivation always seems to slip away.
                Starting a habit is an excellent way to start. Whether it is at the beginning, middle, or end of the day, it is good to try and set aside some time for writing.

                Fortunately, the nice thing about writing is that is an activity that can be done anywhere. You can write at home, on the road,
                or even at the edge of a cliff if you're brave enough. Truthfully, words follow you. And I assure you, <i>there is no <b>escape</b></i>.

        <section id="how">
            <h2>How The <s>Sausage</s> Writing Gets Made</h2>

            <p>
                While writing guides and gurus will tell you a medley of different ways to write or become one with the written way, there is no true way to start writing. 
                There are different methods to get you started, of course. I personally just let the ideas ruminate in the back of my head while I go about my day until they burst
                forth like rotten fruit, spilling and staining my decomposing flesh. I will not be free of their grasp nor stench until I put them to paper, and they/I will not rest 
                until then. My innards will rot unless given escape from my earthly coil.

            </p>

            <p>
                From there, it's just a fun time of combining all the fun nonsensities of the English language in a way that you <i>hope</i> makes sense. Personally, my favorite part
                is writing something that I feel is really strong, putting it down for a few days, and then coming back to wonder how I ever thought stringing those words together in <i>that</i>
                way ever made sense to anyone with a reading comprehension above the third grade.

        <section id="why">   
            <h2>Why Combine Nouns, Verbs, and the Horror of Prepositional Phrases?</h2>

            <p>
                For as long as I have been a writer, I have been a reader for even longer. Since I was a child, I have devoured books. My parents often 
                joked that there was "no point in getting me book since I would finish it by the end of the day". And honestly? They were right. I could sit
                down and read books with over 400 pages in a single day wihtout a problem even in middle school for no reason other than I wanted to witness the worlds
                created by others. 
            <p>

            <p>
                Despite my love for reading, it wasn't until highschool that I considered putting my own thoughts to paper. I'm not sure why it took me so long to consider it.
                It wasn't like I wasn't creative enough or didn't know how to write, but I imagine it was the same as most things people enjoy. When you enjoy something so much as
                a consumer, you never really consider stopping and becoming a producer.
            </p>
                

            <p>
                And yet, one day I did.
            </p>

            <p>
                The thing is when you're an avid reader that is constantly searching for your next hit is that over time you develop certain tastes. 
                You can really only handle <i>so many</i> vampires lurking in the shadows watching you sleep, and you swear if <i>one more heroine who 
                allegedly can bring down an entire battalion of evil bad guys</i> swoons and falls in love with the picture-perfect definition of a 
                walking red flag... well, you might just have to burn the whole place down.
            </p>

            <p>
                So I, like any other fourteen year old with too many words, a big enough head, and not enough sense, started creating worlds <i>I</i> wanted to see.
                Of course, they were terrible and had all of the characters should have been named Mary Sue for all the character development and lack of human qualities,
                but I did it. 
            </p>

            <p>
                And from there, the story continues.
