			<h2>Writing for <s>Dummies</s> Me</h2>
            <p>
                Writing is the base of humanity. We use it to find ways to define our thoughts, feelings, and expressions of our inner beings.
                With it, we can create something out of nothing. Humanity is nothing if not a culmination of our past reimagining itself
                to fit into our future, and writing acheives that. It gives us an outlet so that all of the raging noise within
                our heads finally escapes. Writing helps release the pressure of overwhelming thoughts and visions that feel like they'll
                seep out our orifices if not granted escaped from our mortal coils. <p>

                <p>That is to say, I enjoy writing.</p>

                <p>Writing to me is cathartic and helps to soothe the creator's soul. There's so much range when it comes to writing as well,
                which gives it so much more life. If I tired of horror, I can create a comedy. If laughs grow too loud for my ears,
                I can craft a tragedy that will make even the hardest lacrimal glands ache from pressure. There is a freedom in writing that I adore,
                and I hope the awe will never leave me.

            <h2>Why Combine Nouns, Verbs, and the Horror of Prepositional Phrases?</h2>

            <p>
                For as long as I have been a writer, I have been a reader for even longer. Since I was a child, I have devoured books. My parents often 
                joked that there was "no point in getting me book since I would finish it by the end of the day". And honestly? They were right. I could sit
                down and read books with over 400 pages in a single day wihtout a problem even in middle school for no reason other than I wanted to witness the worlds
                created by others. 
            <p>

            <p>
                Despite my love for reading, it wasn't until highschool that I considered putting my own thoughts to paper. I'm not sure why it took me so long to consider it.
                It wasn't like I wasn't creative enough or didn't know how to write, but I imagine it was the same as most things people enjoy. When you enjoy something so much as
                a consumer, you never really consider stopping and becoming a producer.
            </p>
                

            <p>
                And yet, one day I did.
            </p>

            <p>
                The thing is when you're an avid reader that is constantly searching for your next hit is that over time you develop certain tastes. 
                You can really only handle <i>so many</i> vampires lurking in the shadows watching you sleep, and you swear if <i>one more heroine who 
                allegedly can bring down an entire battalion of evil bad guys</i> swoons and falls in love with the picture-perfect definition of a 
                walking red flag... well, you might just have to burn the whole place down.
            </p>

            <p>
                So I, like any other fourteen year old with too many words, a big enough head, and not enough sense, started creating worlds <i>I</i> wanted to see.
                Of course, they were terrible and had all of the characters should have been named Mary Sue for all the character development and lack of human qualities,
                but I did it. 
            </p>

            <p>
                And from there, the story continues.

                        Can you explain to me what this is asking me to do for an assignment based on creating a single html file that will have different sections?

                    <il>
                        Can you explain to me what an event listener would be or look like?
