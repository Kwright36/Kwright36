        <h2>Website Evaluations</h2>
        <section>
            <h3><a href="https://www.heavensgate.com/"> Heaven's Gate Website </a></h3>
            <p>
                Heaven's Gate is a renowned website for both it's content and display thereof. It's presence
                still haunts the internet with it's presence. The website was originally intended to
                entice potential followers with their doctrine to "leave this world and go with Ti's crew" with Hopes
                of "[preparing] for membership in Their Kingdom, and to experience Their boundless Caring and Nurturing."

            </p>

            <p>
                Of course, now the website stands to remind us of the past and the dangers of allowing dangerous people access
                to the vunerable.
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    <b>Contrast: </b> The website definitely fails with creating proper contrast. The fonts are too bright and varied,
                    which can lead to eye strain and confusion when attempting to read.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Repetition: </b> The website also struggles with maintaining consistentcy. Different pages lead to different appearances,
                    ways of displaying the information, and font colors.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Alignment: </b> The alignment for the website varies. While the main text tends to be centered, there are pages where it changes to
                    justified. As such, the balance of the page struggles as does its alginment.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Proximity: </b> I would argue that the website also fails in this aspect. While there are images added to the text,
                    they don't often add clarity or seem to be truly referenced within the text itself but rather added haphazardly. However, it is utilized well
                    <a href="https://www.heavensgate.com/misc/member.htm"> here</a> when describing "How a Member of the Kingdom of Heaven might appear."
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3><a href="https://twistinthetale.com/">Twist in the Tale</a></h3>

            <p>
                Twist in the Tale is a writing website that serves as both the home base for writing competitions as well as a place to get involved with writing communities
                and exchange stories if wanted. The site offers different levels of interactivity ranging from free weekly writing contests that will be judged by peer writers 
                to paid competitions where writers can enter their work and hope to win a cash prize. Additionally, there are options for changing the appearance of the user's chosen
                avatar.
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    <b>Contrast: </b> The website uses differences between text color and surrounding background colors well. The green and white of the text are not heavily contrasting,
                     which makes it much easier to read and understand. The font type is also very clear and well-weighted.
                </li>

                <li>
                    <b>Repetition: </b> The formatting and display of information is consistent across the website. The headings, paragraphs, and flow appear if not the same then very similar 
                    on each page.
                </li>

                <li>
                    <b>Alignment: </b> Everything is well aligned and makes sense to the viewer. As such, everything feels very balanced when looking at the pages.
                </li>

                <li>
                    <b>Proximity: </b> The website does well with using proximity to combine ideas and topics. Whenever multiple ideas or topics are introduced, everything related is in close
                    proximity with one another.

                </li>
            </ul>
