        <h2><emphasis>About the Killer Wombat</emphasis></h2>

        <p>
            Killer Wombat's Phantasms is an eclectic collection of items collected from places ranging from the yawning pit underneath your sink
            to the questionably wanted gift-curses left behind by The Woman at your front door. We deal in the known, the unknown, and everything in between.
        </p>

        <p>
            Are you looking to rid yourself of that conchshell that whispers terrifying knowledge deep into your cochlea whenever you pick it up?
            <em>Bring it in!</em>

        </p>

        <p>
            Looking to drive your business competitors slowly insane by hiring the services of a banshee that will scream outside their window and fortell their death until they give into your whims?
            <em>Look no further than the Killer Wombat!</em>
        </p>

        <p>

            To put it succintly, we want your unwanted. We also want to grant you your greatest desires no matter the impact of your selfish desires.
            We aren't here to play with Fate. Simply to offer you the chance to do so.
        </p>
